	<div class="title"><h1>Lesson 1: Getting Started with HTML</h1></div>

		<div class="subhead"><b><u>How the web works</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>The web is a network of computers that exists as a collection of hubs. A computer will send an http request to a server, which then finds an appropraite <b>html</b> document and returns it to the user's computer thorugh a browser.</p></div>

		<div class="subhead"><b><u>HTML = hyper text markup language</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>hyper - links<br>text - what you see<br>markup - how it looks<br>language - programming syntax</p></div>

		<div class="subhead"><b><u>Tags and elements</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>html documents are composed of elements. We instruct the webpage to incorporate elements through the use of tags.</p></div>

		<div class="subhead"><b><u>Inline vs block elements</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>html elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an invisible block around them, so will reflect more detail in text arrangements.</p></div>

	<div class="title"><h1>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h1></div>

		<div class="subhead"><b><u>Developer Tools (in the browser)</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p></div>

		<div class="subhead"><b><u>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...</p></div>

		<div class="subhead"><b><u>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.</p></div>

		<div class="subhead"><b><u>Text Editors (for programming)</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.</p></div>

	<div class="title"><h1>Lesson 3: Adding CSS for Style</h1></div>

		<div class="subhead"><b><u>Methods for including CSS Styling in web pages</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>Method 1: write CSS in the head of your HTML.<br>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file<br>Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML</p></div>
		<div class="subhead"><b><u>Box Sizing</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>There are four main points that Jessica addressed about box sizing:<br>1. HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components<br>2. Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.<br>3. There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues: a/ Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels; b/ Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.<br>4. Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.</p></div>
		<div class="subhead"><b><u>Box Positioning</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.<br>Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</p></div>
		<div class="subhead"><b><u>Avoid Repetition</u></b></div>
			<div class="content"><p>Avoidance of repetition in your code allows elements to be modified without further alterations to other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, all elements that are logically related will change predictably and uniformly, thus are kept in sync.</p></div>
